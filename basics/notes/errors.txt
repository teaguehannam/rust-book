Grouped into two major categories
	
	recoverable
		eg. file not found
			report problem, and retry
		Using the enum "Result" can recover from errors instead of aborting 

	unrecoverable
		eg. bugs, trying to access location beyond memory
			immediately stops the program

		Responses (panic)
			By default, the program starts unwinding
				walks back and cleans up the stack, and data from functions
	
			Alternatively, putting this in the Cargo.toml:
				[profile.release]
				panic = 'abort'
			makes the resulting binary small as possible,
			by aborting immediatly after an unrecoverable error
