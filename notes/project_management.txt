As a package grows, parts can be extracted into separate crates that become external depenencies.
This allow for reuseability, and defines the which parts are public vs private.

Packages and Crates
	
	"crate root" is the source file that the compiler starts from

	"package" is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality
		contains a Cargo.toml file, which describes how to build crates

	Cargo.toml follows a convention that src/main.rs is the crate root

Modules
	
	Organize code within a create into groups for readability and reuse

	Control the privacy of the items
		public - can be used outside code
		private - internal implementation not available for outside use
