Ownership 
	Allows memory safety without a garbage collector
	Each value has a variable that's called its owner
	Only one owner at a time
	When owner out of scope, value is dropped

Data
	Stack
		Last in, First Out (like a stack of plates)
		Adding data is called pushing onto the stack
		removing data is called popping off the stack
		All data must have a known, fixed size
		Unknown size must be stored on the heap
		Pushing to stack is faster than allocating on the heap

	Heap
		Allocating space, and accessing data in the heap is slower
		Marks empty memory spot with enough space,
		and returns a pointer (address of location)
		Like being seated at a restaurant
			How many people (data size)
			staff finds empty table that fits everyone
			Anyone who is late, can be pointed to your table
