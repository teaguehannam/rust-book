Ownership 
	Allows memory safety without a garbage collector
	Each value has a variable that's called its owner
	Only one owner at a time
	When owner out of scope, value is dropped

References
	Must always be valid
	At any given time, you can have either:
		One mutable reference 
		Any number of immutable references

Slice Type
	Contiguous sequence of element in a collection,
		rather than the whole collection
	Kind of reference, doesn't have ownership
