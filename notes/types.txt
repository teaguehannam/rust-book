Types:

	Scalar types

		integers (no fractional component)
			Signed: if number can be negative (+/- before it)
			Types (default = i32)
				8-bit: signed(i8) unsigned(u8)
				16-bit: signed(i16) unsigned(u16)
				32-bit: signed(i32) unsigned(u32)
				64-bit: signed(i64) unsigned(u64)
				128-bit: signed(i128) unsigned(u128)
				arch: signed(isize) unsigned(usize)
			Literals:
				Decimal - 98_222
				Hex - 0xff
				Octal - 0o77
				Binary - 0b1111_0000
				Byte (u8 only) - a'A'

		floating-point numbers (IEEE-754 standard)
			Types (default = f64, similar performance on modern CPUs)
				f32 - single precision
				f64 - double precision

		Booleans 
			can be true or false
			1 byte in size

		characters
			char literals declared with single quotes
			string literals declared with double quotes
			four bytes and represent a Unicode Scalar Value
			can represent more than just ASCII

	Compound Types
	
		Tuple
			groups together values with a variety of types into one type

		Array
			All elements have the same type
			Have a fixed length, and stored on the stack

	Generic Types

		Abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties
